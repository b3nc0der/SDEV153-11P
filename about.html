<h1>About Me</h1>
             I am. I exist. I am a father and a son. I have two beautiful daughters. I am a husband. I have been married 18 years on July 7th. Seven, seven, oh-seven. Lucky number, blessed life. I still have my parents. I have outlived my grandparents. Am I still a grandson? This project is part of a new segment in my life. I have 25 or so years of employment ahead of me and I need something different. The last time I took college courses, I was unemployed, laid off and granted funds to attend training opportunities. I was discouraged from seeking employment during that time. This time the dime is mine and I am working full time. I seek to provide for my family. I have found problem solving and troubleshooting to be my main interest, not my current career path. I think the opportunities in software development are vast. I have always been interested in IT, but have not heard my calling. Still looking, but fervently hoping to stave off boredom. More to follow.
